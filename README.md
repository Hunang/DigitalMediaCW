# Graph Processing
The INFECTIOUS dataset describes the face-to-face behaviour of people during the exhibition “INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY” in 2009 at the Science Gallery in Dublin.

Nodes are exhibition visitors and edges are face-to-face contacts active for at least 20 seconds. The network is partially connected, as all nodes are connected to at least one other node. Multiple edges between two nodes were possible, but those were removed so only the unique contacts remain.
